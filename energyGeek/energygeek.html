								<h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
								<p>Using subsea multiphase pump and other processing and pumping technologies, Petrobras’ aim is to expand knowledge of new subseato-somewhere-related technologies, permitting their application on a large scale by 2020. This application’s major challenges involve guaranteeing the electricity supply to power equipment on the seabed and the need to install pumps capable of raising the pressure of fluids, especially liquids, to transfer them to the shore. </p>

								<p>The shift to the seabed of certain types of equipment currently installed on production units is in line with the “toolbox” concept, which is aimed at enabling production in fields with manydifferent characteristics by applying varied combinations of each “tool.” Two years after these new technologies were installed, Petrobras technicians are now verifying their first results. Regarding subsea gas-liquid separation, Petrobras already has equipment capable of doing this, such as the vertical annular separation and pumping system (VASPS). However, the separated liquid needs to be pumped to the platform – hence the importance of subsea pumps.</p>

								    <p>However, what if it were possible to transfer to the seabed, near the production and injection wells, several kinds of equipment currently installed on platforms to conduct these activities? Based on this idea, two concepts have arisen and the technology areas of oil and gas companies across the world have been busy working on them: “subsea to somewhere” and “subsea to shore.”</p>

									<p>In subsea to somewhere, the first apparent benefit is saving space on platforms by transferring equipment to the seabed. However, this application may have much broader potential, avoiding the use of new facilities to produce oil and gas. In new discoveries, depending on their size and recoverable volume, the processing and injection plants would be installed on the seabed.
</p>
<p>The volumes treated by this equipment would be transferred to a production facility in a region farther away, generally in shallower waters. Subsea to shore, on the other hand, is an even more radical concept: it entails doing all the hydrocarbon processing on the seabed and then directly transferring the volumes produced to the coast, without using a platform. The use of this concept would avoid the installation of a new production unit, thereby cutting the associated investment and operating costs.</p>
	<p>Petrobras has already carried out tests in Brazil with an eye to the future use of subsea to somewhere. One of the most notable innovations currently being applied is the subsea multiphase pump. Operating since 2012, the subsea multiphase pumping has been installed in Barracuda field, Campos Basin. Connected to production well BR-73 and platform P-48, the pump – which is able to work with gas and liquid mixed in any proportion, raising oil production – is activated by electricity conveyed by the production unit, using cutting-edge technology. The system has already increased the field’s output by around 6,000 barrels per day. Conventional subsea pumping systems have limitations with regard to the gas/liquid proportion, and so are not suited to any oil field with associated gas – a common characteristic of Brazil’s offshore reservoirs. Besides raising production, the use of subsea multiphase pump is capable of increasing the recovery factor (productivity) of reservoirs and enabling production using wells that are farther from the platform.</p>

									<h3>Arise the concepts</h3>
									<p>At the turn of the century, with the expansion of oil exploration and production into ever-deeper waters, progress in the automation field, the rising number of mature fields (areas operating for a long time that have started to produce more water) and the discovery of small accumulations of oil and gas in regions near already-installed platforms, the industry began to work with the possibility of avoiding or at least reducing the need to install new production units. This led to the development of the “subsea to somewhere” and “subsea to shore” concepts, which include the processing of liquids and gases, the transmission and distribution of electric power on the seabed, and systems for remotely operating and monitoring these activities – processes now carried out on platforms installed in fields.</p>

									<h3>In the world</h3>
									<p> The Ormen Lange and Snohvit natural gas field projects in Norway have a characteristic as yet unusual in today’s oil industry: the entire output of the areas, located around 100 km off the country’s coast, is transported without using any platform along the way. They are so far the world’s only examples of the subsea to shore concept to have been applied.</p>
