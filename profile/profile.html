There are systems governed by simple, regular laws, making it easy to describe their long-term behavior, but when new factors are included in the equation, even systems governed by very simple laws can adopt very complex behaviors, resulting in unexpected conclusions. It was due to his work in this area of research that Brazilian mathematician Artur Ávila received a Fields Medal – the highest honor in mathematics – in 2014 and is today one of the most respected researchers in the world in the field of dynamic systems research.</p>
								    <p>It all began at the age of 12, when Ávila was invited by a teacher to take part in the Mathematical Olympiads. Without yet knowing which profession he would follow, the experience, repeated many times at other editions of the contest, led him to choose his vocation. Today, at the age of 35, Ávila divides his time between Brazil, where he directs the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), an organization that reports to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and France, where he leads the National Center for Scientific Research. He spends around six months per year in each country.</p>

								      Had he been able to look into the future, his career would perhaps have been surprising to Ávila at the time when he was a hard-working student at the Colégio de São Bento, a traditional school in Rio de Janeiro. He studied more than what was presented in the classroom, but did not yet know that mathematics could be a profession. In 1992, at the age of 13, invited by one of his teachers, Fabiano Pinheiro, Ávila decided to participate, for the first time and without any preparation, in the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad (known by Portuguese acronym OBM). “When I started to take part in the Olympiads, I didn’t have any notion of what a profession was. I viewed mathematics merely as a way to learn,” he explains.</p>

								      <p>
								      In his first competition, Ávila won the bronze medal – but not without any effort. “The competition lasted two days, with three questions per day. We had a lot of time to reflect about each question, but it wasn’t at all obvious how you would solve each one. And I didn’t understand anything. On the one hand, having contact with this competition was hard for me, but it also showed me an interesting thing: to perform well, you need to use your imagination and really delve into the problem,” he recalls.</p>
								      <p>
								      The following year, now aware of what was awaiting him, Ávila came first in the OBM. It was the start of a trajectory that would lead him to win a Fields Prize, the most prestigious award ever won by a Brazilian mathematician. But this was still very far off for the boy who joined a master’s program at IMPA in 1995, at the age of 16, while he was still at high school, doing his schoolwork alongside his scientific development in mathematics.</p>

									<h3> Olympiads </h3>
								    <p>The first Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad (OBM) was held in 1979 by the Brazilian Mathematics Society (SBM). Today, in conjunction with the Public School Mathematical Olympiads – an IMPA initiative that reached its 10th anniversary in 2014 – the OMB is used to select students to represent Brazil in the various international competitions in the field, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad, the Cone Sul Olympiad and the Iberoamerican Olympiad.</p>
								    <p>
								    In 2014, around 18 million students enrolled in the Public School Mathematical Olympiads. “There are prize-winning students in the remotest municipalities, proving that mathematical talent is distributed pretty uniformly across Brazil. The increase in Brazilian participation over the years and the country’s strong performance in the ranking have been fundamental to the educational development of the subject at public schools,” says IMPA general director, César Camacho.</p>

									<h3>The 10 martini challenge</h3>
									<p>In 1980, American physicist and mathematician Barry Simon promised to buy 10 measures of James Bond’s favorite drink for whoever could explain the behavior of mathematical tools known as Schrödinger Operators. In 2005, in partnership with Russian mathematician Svetlana Jitomirskaya, Ávila solved the puzzle. Contrary to the legend, however, there were no celebratory martinis. “There are mathematical problems that have remained unsolved for a long time, and some of them have turned into folklore. In this case, people thought it would get more attention with this name regarding 10 martinis, but this isn’t the objective of anyone who works on a puzzle like this. Ten martinis is very little reward for the effort involved. Previous work had already made significant progress toward the solution, but my coauthor and I together solved the problem. However, I don’t particularly like martinis,” concludes Ávila.</p>

									<p>“Even though the institute offers this flexibility, in my case it wasn’t that simple. I found out that the mathematician Carlos Gustavo Moreira, ‘Gugu,’ an IMPA researcher and member of the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiads Commission, had taken an MA at IMPA while doing his high school education. I was a little late on the scene and I wasn’t much encouraged because I had missed the deadlines. However, what happened was that, the same year, I attended several Olympiads, the main one being the International Mathematical Olympiad, in which I won gold. It was a better result that I had expected and, when I got back, I went to IMPA and they offered me a scientific initiation scholarship,” recounts Ávila.</p>
									<p>
									Regarding the Fields Prize, following the exhaustive process from his initial nomination, kept secret, until the awards ceremony, Ávila sees it as a challenge overcome and prefers to focus on what is yet to come in his research. “When I found out I had received the prize, I felt relieved, because there is a lot of pressure on potential candidates, and this ends up taking away a little of our focus from the research we are doing. When the result came out, I only felt relieved and the desire to return to my object of study,” the mathematician concludes.
